While analyzing the data in this challenge, i have learned a lot about school performance.
in this challenge the data was broken down in many different ways, including how many students were at each school, average budget, type of school, and math and reading scores, among others.
I was able to see how each variable affected each other as we broke down the data in different ways to compare it.

The first conclusion i can draw from this data is that school size has a much bigger impact on student test results than budget per student. Smaller schools with similar budgets per student scored much better than large schools.

The second conclusion i was able to draw was that Charter schools perform much better than disctrict schools in these test results. i believe this can be attributed to the smaller teacher to student ratio charter schools have.
